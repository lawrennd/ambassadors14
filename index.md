Learning from Data
------------------

### Building a Recommender System

Welcome to my page on "Learning from Data" for the [Department's
Ambassadors' programme](http://ambassadors.rcweb.dcs.shef.ac.uk/). The
programme is targeted at school students with an interest in mathematics
and computer science. I was asked by Guy Brown, who put the programme
together, to pull together a session on learning from data. And this is
the result. All the details are given in the IPython notebook below.

The notes for this session can be viewed
[here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/lawrennd/ambassadors14/blob/master/movie_recommender.ipynb).

But, we are actually going to run the session on our own computers in
the ipython notebook. To do this you need to firstly open the ipython
notebook. Then paste the following code into the ipython notebook.

    import urllib
    urllib.urlretrieve('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lawrennd/ambassadors14/master/movie_recommender.ipynb', 'movie_recommender.ipynb')

You should now be able to find the lab class by clicking `File->Open` on
the ipython notebook menu.
